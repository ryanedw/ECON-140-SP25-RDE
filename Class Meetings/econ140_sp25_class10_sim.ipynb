    "With the benefit of omniscience, we recover the generating function: a coefficient on `female` of $-0.3$, a coefficient on occupation of $0.2$, and a coefficient on `ability` roughly equal to $0.4$. Just like in the simple model that we started with far above, the marginal effect of `female` here is smaller than its total effect because we have conditioned on `occupation`."

    "Is it always a mistake to control for other characteristics? Definitely not. But especially when the research question has to do with <i>disparities</i>, or inequalities that should not exist from a normative or moral perspective, the choice of controls can be controversial.\n",

    "Most studies of the labor market find that workers with more years of labor market <b>experience</b> typically earn more. Other things equal, older workers will have more experience than younger workers, and thus we probably would expect there to be an earnings benefit associated with age. In other words, we would probably not perceive wage inequality favoring older workers as unjust.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a cross section of workers, <b>experience</b> and <b>education</b> are often negatively correlated. There are two reasons why: acquiring years education past the age of compulsory schooling typically requires sacrificing years of work experience; and older birth cohorts typically had less access to education than younger birth cohorts.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are interested in the effect of education on earnings, then <i>we should control for experience</i> or age in the regression, comparing apples-to-apples. Experience or age is probably a <b>good control</b> in an earnings regression in most cases. There are situations when the causal effect of a treatment variable on earnings might flow through experience; see for example the voluminous work on gender inequality by 2023 Nobel Laureate in Economics, [Claudia Goldin](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2023/prize-announcement/). But for many other situations, age is likely to be a more immutable characteristic. "
